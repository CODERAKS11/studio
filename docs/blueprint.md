# **App Name**: DSA Wake-Up

## Core Features:

- DSA Progress Dashboard: Dashboard displays DSA questions with LeetCode-style progress tracking. Completed questions have checked boxes, while uncompleted ones have empty checkboxes.
- Customizable Alarm Creation: Set an alarm with a selected time (defaulting to 7:00 AM) and a minimum of 3 DSA questions. Upon triggering the alarm, options appear to 'Start' or snooze for '5 Minutes Later'.
- Timed Question Verification: Displays a 20-minute timer for each question selected within the alarm, requiring the user to upload a photo verifying completion of the solution.
- Persistent Alarm: The alarm will keep repeating and sound until the current question is completed within the time limit and is verified with photo proof.
- Image Analysis: Generative AI tool assesses uploaded picture to confirm if question matches work. Picture analysis to accept only pictures of actual work done on that quesiton (not a picture of nature, for example)

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A deep purple (#673AB7) to evoke a sense of focus and determination, aligned with the commitment to DSA study.
- Background color: A very dark, desaturated purple (#121217), almost black, providing high contrast.
- Accent color: A vibrant yellow-green (#AEEA00), analogous to purple, to highlight actionable elements.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for a modern, techy feel.
- Body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) providing readability for long durations of use and works well for detailed instructions or descriptions.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for any inline code snippets or specific DSA algorithm references.
- Minimalist icons in a linear style, using the accent color to indicate interactive elements or progress states.
- A clean and structured layout that is optimized for mobile, featuring clear delineation between dashboard sections, alarm settings, and question displays.
- Subtle transitions and feedback animations on user interactions such as toggling progress, uploading pictures, or confirming completion.
